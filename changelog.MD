# changelog

# 14th October

* Changed `Phi`: questions asks for only 2 paramters (I dropped the need for `t`)
* Progress summary: done all of Q3 apart from final part. Q4b needs answer from 4a to be combined with answer from 3ci.

# 12th October

* Reformatted repo.
* Changed attempt for 1a to be a line chart rather than scatter plot.
* Changed naming of shuffled splits to `X_shuf_train`, `y_shuf_train`, `X_shuf_val`, `y_shuf_val`, `X_shuf_test` and `y_shuf_test` as per the definitions in the question (1b).
* Changed operation of `phi_quartic` to work for 1 sample instead of a batch of samples (to allow individual testing).

# Pre 12th

* Max original notebook.
