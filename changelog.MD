# changelog


# 12th October

* Reformatted repo.
* Changed attempt for 1a to be a line chart rather than scatter plot.
* Changed naming of shuffled splits to `X_shuf_train`, `y_shuf_train`, `X_shuf_val`, `y_shuf_val`, `X_shuf_test` and `y_shuf_test` as per the definitions in the question (1b).
* Changed operation of `phi_quartic` to work for 1 sample instead of a batch of samples (to allow individual testing).
